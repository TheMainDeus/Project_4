# Persistent Temporal Energy Dynamics

**Author:** Dr. L. Vardien Askel
**Status:** Open Research Draft
**Contact:** themaindeus@proton.me

## Overview

This repository presents a theoretical–experimental framework for studying time as an active field capable of sustaining energy persistence, even in scenarios of minimal or absent material support. The framework defines temporal structures, energy modes, flows, and patterns that are measurable, persistent, and reproducible across different simulation platforms, while integrating multiscale correlations, sensitivity analyses, and predictive modeling.

The goal is to provide a unified, auditable approach for exploring energy persistence driven by temporal dynamics, cross-platform validation, and operational extrapolation, while remaining accessible to scientific collaborators.

## Contents

* **/text/** — Conceptual manuscript detailing theoretical definitions, operational guidelines, and model structures related to operative time and energy persistence.
* **/simulations/** — Guidelines for multiscale simulations, temporal operators, predictive kernels, and persistence analyses.
* **/experiments/** — Framework for experimental validation within current technological limits, including reproducibility criteria and cross-platform comparison.
* **/examples/** — Sample simulations and illustrative persistence predictions.

Each component emphasizes transparency, verification, and methodological clarity.

## Key Features

* Definition and measurement of energy persistence modes driven by temporal structures.
* Quantitative criteria to distinguish persistent temporal energy from transient or spurious effects.
* Bayesian ensembles and statistical reconstruction of temporal energy patterns.
* Predictive kernels with cross-validation, noise filtering, and robustness tests.
* Modular, auditable framework supporting reproducibility and verification.

## Reproducibility

Protocols and structures ensure replicability across independent simulation and laboratory environments:

* Standardized data formats, metadata, and conceptual vectors.
* Statistical criteria for significance, error control, and signal-to-noise validation.
* Pre-simulation pipelines for model validation prior to experimental implementation.
* Guidelines for documenting results and reporting reproducibility metrics.
